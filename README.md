# Push-and-Pop-Calculator
This calculator requires a space after every input character, so only 0-9 can be inputted.  It follows the order of operations by outputting exactly what is executed after each character is looked at.  This calculator can do all operations in PEMDAS, and also use the modulus symbol (%).
